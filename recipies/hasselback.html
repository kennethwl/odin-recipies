    <img src="../img/hasselback.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>All time classic potato preperation. Popular in America, but originated in northern Europe.</h2>
    <h3>A small history lesson.</h3>
    <p>The name is derived from the restaurant where they were first introduced in the 1940s, Hasselbacken in Stockholm, Sweden which opened in that city in 1748 and where they are called hasselbackspotatis. Hasselback potatoes are a simple dish, and in their simplest form, are nothing more than whole potatoes cut in such a way as to resemble a fan or accordion when roasted. The outside of the potato becomes crisp and brown while the inside is soft and creamy. </p>

        <li>Put the two wooden sticks on spoons parralel next to eachother on the cutting board. Add the potato on top so that the bottem of the potato touches the board, but the rest rests on the sticks.</li>
